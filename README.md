# Line-Follower

Made by Dinu Gabriel and Neacsu VLad

Coordinated by Andrei Dumitriu

The project consists of creating a simple line follower using the laboratory kit. It that has to finish a track made by the proffessor and ensure that it does so in the least time possible. With the code attached, our line follower managed to finish the track in 18.2 seconds, securing the highest mark ( given only to times under 20 seconds). There is also a video attached to see it in action.

  Arduino Uno
  QTR-8A reflectance sensor, along with screws
